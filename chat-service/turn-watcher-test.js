/**
 * When a turn ending becomes a notification, and — mostly — when it does not.
 *
 * The failure everyone has met is not a missing notification, it is a phone that
 * buzzes for nothing: twice for one answer, once for something said an hour ago,
 * once per conversation the moment a service restarts, or for the message you are
 * already reading in the app. Each of those is a separate rule in turn-watcher.js
 * and each has a section here, because the only way to find out otherwise is to
 * carry the phone around for a day.
 *
 * Everything runs against real transcript files in a temporary CLAUDE_HOME, with
 * push and the session manager passed in as fakes. `scan()` is called directly, so
 * nothing here waits on the poll interval except the one check that the loop runs
 * at all.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/turn-watcher-test.js
