/**
 * Hearing a message in the chat app, rather than reading it.
 *
 * Dictation was the whole of voice in this app for a long time, which is half a
 * conversation: you can talk to Claude from a phone and then have to read the
 * answer. This covers the other half — the control on each of Claude's messages,
 * and the one under each code block in it.
 *
 * Everything interesting about it is invisible from a desktop browser and
 * inaudible from a test, so it is driven directly:
 *
 *  - **What a block button sends.** A code block is read by the server
 *    (`kind: 'code'`, which becomes "indent two" and "arrow" and a line number
 *    every few lines) and never locally, because a browser voice reads code as a
 *    minute of punctuation names. The block, the fence's language, and no
 *    surrounding prose.
 *  - **That the nth button reads the nth block.** The renderer and the reader
 *    split fences with one shared regex; a button that reads the wrong block is
 *    worse than no button, and two independent parsers agreeing today is not a
 *    guarantee about tomorrow.
 *  - **That nothing is offered when the server cannot read.** No Polly
 *    permission, no Azure or OpenAI key, an older server with no such route: all
 *    of them mean no controls at all rather than buttons that explain a 401.
 *  - **Hebrew.** An unset voice means "whichever fits the message", decided per
 *    message on the server — which is the only arrangement where a Hebrew answer
 *    is read in Hebrew on a phone nobody configured.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/read-test.js
