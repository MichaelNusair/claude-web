/**
 * One manifest per project, because that is what a second window costs on Android.
 *
 * The platform fact this rests on: Chrome gives an installed web app exactly one
 * window on a phone, and no API opens a second. App *identity* is the only lever —
 * a manifest with an unfamiliar `id` is a distinct application even when served
 * from the same URL, and a distinct application on Android is a distinct icon with
 * its own task. If the id ever stops differing per project the symptom is silent:
 * adding a second project to the home screen quietly replaces the first icon
 * instead of joining it.
 *
 * The id is not sufficient, only necessary, which is the lesson that cost a release.
 * An installed app claims URLs by *scope*, a path prefix compared without the query
 * string, so projects differing only in `?folder=` were one app to Android and only
 * the first could be installed — "already installed" for the rest. Hence a path per
 * project, `/p/<name>/`, and hence the last section of this file: that path is a
 * promise only nginx can keep, and it is written in another language in another
 * directory.
 *
 * The other thing checked here is drift. The fields that are not project-specific
 * are written out in manifest.js rather than read from pwa/manifest.webmanifest,
 * because that file lives somewhere else at runtime. This test is what keeps the
 * duplicate honest.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/manifest-test.js
