/**
 * The voice that reads a message out loud.
 *
 * Read aloud used to be the browser's own `speechSynthesis`, which is the voice
 * the platform gives away: on Android it is flat, it mispronounces every
 * identifier, and it breathes in the wrong places, so a summary read out of it is
 * something you decode rather than listen to. The point of that button is to hear
 * the answer while walking, driving or waiting — and a voice you have to
 * concentrate on defeats it.
 *
 * So the audio is synthesised on the box now, and the browser only plays it.
 * Amazon Polly, because this instance already has an AWS role and already talks to
 * Bedrock: nothing new to sign up for, no API key to keep, and no third party in
 * the path of a private conversation. Its *generative* engine, because that is the
 * tier that sounds like a person rather than an announcement — it pauses where the
 * sentence pauses, puts the stress on the right word, and reads "auth.js, line 42
 * to 51" as a phrase instead of a list of tokens.
 *
 * Measured from this instance against us-east-1 on 2026-09-18, Ruth/generative:
 *
 *     chars   first byte   synthesis   audio it makes   synthesis/audio
 *       160        204ms        1.9s            9.4s            0.20x
 *       240        143ms        2.7s           13.7s            0.20x
 *       450        134ms        4.7s           25.7s            0.18x
 *       850        148ms        9.3s           48.5s            0.19x
 *      1600        149ms       16.8s           90.7s            0.18x
 *
 * Two of those numbers decide the whole design.
 *
 * **Synthesis takes about a fifth of the time its own audio takes to play.** So a
 * message is cut into pieces and each piece is built while the previous one is
 * still playing, with a five-fold margin. Nothing has to be waited for after the
 * first piece, and a listener hears one continuous message.
 *
 * **The wait for that first piece is proportional to its length.** Hence
 * `FIRST_SEGMENT_CHARS`: the opening piece is one or two sentences, so the voice
 * starts in about two seconds instead of the twenty-three a whole message takes.
 * Everything after it is `SEGMENT_CHARS`, which is long enough that the boundaries
 * are rare and always fall where a sentence already ended.
 *
 * Pieces are also what makes stopping cheap. Polly bills per character submitted,
 * so a message abandoned after the first sentence costs one segment rather than
 * all of it — which matters because the *reason* to stop is usually that you have
 * heard enough.
 *
 * What this refuses, and why each refusal exists:
 *
 *  - **A daily character budget** (`SPEAK_DAILY_CHARS`). Generative Polly is $30
 *    per million characters, so a full 2400-character read is about 7 cents and a
 *    loop that re-reads a message every few seconds is real money. A caller that
 *    reaches the budget gets 429 with a sentence saying so, and the client falls
 *    back to the browser voice rather than going quiet.
 *  - **A cap on the text** (`SPEAK_MAX_CHARS`). This is a spoken summary, not an
 *    audiobook; the client already cuts at 2400 characters.
 *  - **An allowlist of voices.** A caller-supplied string is never passed through
 *    to the API: an unknown voice falls back to the default and the answer says
 *    which voice was actually used, so a stale phone with an old name in
 *    localStorage still gets audio.
 *
 * And what it caches: audio is keyed by (engine, voice, text), which is exact,
 * because Polly is deterministic — the same request twice returned byte-identical
 * audio when this was measured. So re-reading a message, or the same message on a
 * second device, is free and instant.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * **There are two synthesisers now, and Hebrew is the reason.**
 *
 * Polly cannot say Hebrew. `polly:DescribeVoices` on this account answers with 40
 * languages and `he-IL` is not one of them — there is no voice, no engine and no
 * region that adds it, so this is not a quality problem to tune but a synthesiser
 * that does not do the job. OpenAI's speech models do (57 languages, tracking
 * Whisper's list), so they are the second provider here, and a message with Hebrew
 * in it is routed to them regardless of which voice the phone remembers. See
 * `pickVoice`.
 *
 * Everything the two providers disagree about is held in the voice registry rather
 * than in the code paths: a voice record carries its `provider`, the `engine` (which
 * for OpenAI is the model name) and its language, and the rest of this file asks the
 * record instead of asking which provider it is dealing with. Two consequences worth
 * knowing:
 *
 *  - **Voice ids stay bare** — `Ruth`, `marin` — rather than being namespaced by
 *    provider. Phones remember the id in `localStorage` (`cmo-voice`), and a
 *    rename would silently drop every device back to the default. The names do not
 *    collide today (Polly's are capitalised, OpenAI's are not) and `knownVoices()`
 *    enforces that they never do, so a Polly voice arriving one day with a name
 *    OpenAI already uses is dropped from the list rather than making the id
 *    ambiguous. `speak-test.js` holds that invariant.
 *  - **The daily budget is per provider**, because the two are not priced alike:
 *    generative Polly is $30 per million characters and `gpt-4o-mini-tts` works out
 *    near $17, so one shared allowance would either starve the cheap one or
 *    overspend on the expensive one.
 *
 * One property the cache relies on is weaker for the second provider: OpenAI does
 * not promise byte-identical audio for an identical request. It does not matter
 * here, because an id is only ever resolved against the bytes this process already
 * synthesised for it — a re-read inside the TTL is the same audio, and after that
 * the entry is gone and there is nothing to be inconsistent with.
