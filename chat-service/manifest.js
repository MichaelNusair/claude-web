/**
 * A web app manifest per project, so a project can be its own window.
 *
 * The problem it solves is an Android one. Chrome gives an installed web app
 * exactly one window — its own documentation says so, in the course of explaining
 * why `launch_handler` defaults differ by platform: "mobile devices only support
 * single clients", while "desktop devices support multiple windows". So on a
 * laptop you can have a window per project and on a phone you cannot, and no
 * amount of JavaScript changes that: there is no API that opens a second window
 * of an installed app.
 *
 * What there *is* is app identity. Per the manifest spec, a manifest whose `id`
 * does not match an installed app "is a description of a distinct application,
 * even if it is served from the same URL as another application" — and a distinct
 * application on Android is a distinct home-screen icon with a task of its own in
 * the recents switcher. Which is the thing that was actually wanted: another
 * window, that looks like another app on the home screen.
 *
 * Identity alone turned out not to be enough, though, and the missing half is
 * `scope`: it is a *path prefix*, matched without the query string, so a set of
 * projects that differ only in `?folder=` are one app to Android whatever their ids
 * say — see projectWindowPath below, which is why /p/<name>/ exists.
 *
 * Nor was a path per project enough on its own, because the chat app's scope was `/`
 * and a path under `/` is still inside it. An installed app claims every URL in its
 * scope, so the chat icon claimed every project, and Chrome answered each project
 * install after it with "already installed". That is why the chat app now starts at
 * /chat/ and scopes itself there — see pwa/manifest.webmanifest, and the redirect
 * from `/` in infra/userdata/bootstrap.sh that keeps the bare domain working.
 *
 * So this hands out one manifest per project, differing in `id`, `start_url`, `scope`
 * and the name on the icon. Same origin, same code, same login, same push
 * subscription — one install per project, once.
 *
 * Everything not project-specific is duplicated from pwa/manifest.webmanifest
 * rather than read out of it, because that file is not in this directory at
 * runtime (deploy.sh copies it into public/) and reaching for it through two
 * different relative paths is worse than one assertion. manifest-test.js compares
 * the two and fails if they drift.

 * tab, the editor's title bar. The chat app, which is not in a project, becomes the
 * name on its own.
