/**
 * Web Push: VAPID, payload encryption, and the list of devices to send to.
 *
 * Why this is hand-rolled rather than a dependency. The encryption is a fixed,
 * fully specified recipe — RFC 8291 for the key agreement, RFC 8188 for the
 * content encoding, RFC 8292 for the signed request — and every primitive it
 * needs is in node's crypto. What a library would add here is not cryptography
 * but a supply chain, on a box whose whole job is running shell commands for
 * whoever is signed in. The published test vector is reproduced exactly in
 * push-test.js, which is a stronger statement about correctness than a version
 * number is.
 *
 * The shape of the thing, in the order a message goes through it:
 *
 *   a device subscribes in the browser, and hands back an endpoint URL and two
 *   keys: `p256dh` (its ECDH public key) and `auth` (a 16-byte secret);
 *
 *   the payload is encrypted *to that device* — the push service in the middle
 *   (Google's, Apple's, Mozilla's) carries it without being able to read it, and
 *   that is the point of the whole ceremony rather than a bonus;
 *
 *   the POST is signed with a keypair that identifies this box, so the push
 *   service can rate-limit and contact the sender. That keypair has to be stable:
 *   a subscription is bound to the public key it was created with, so generating
 *   a new one silently invalidates every device. It is therefore written once,
 *   under CLAUDE_HOME (which lives on the workspace volume and survives a
 *   deploy), and never rewritten.
 *
 * Nothing here knows what a notification is *about*. See turn-watcher.js.

 *   ecdh_secret = ECDH(as_private, ua_public)          -- 32 bytes

 * across messages to the same device reuses the nonce, which is the one mistake
 * AES-GCM does not survive.
