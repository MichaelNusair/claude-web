/**
 * Which model hears you, checked without speaking to any of them.
 *
 * One branch in this file matters more than everything else in it: a request that
 * says it is not English must never reach the local model. `ggml-base.en.bin` given
 * Hebrew speech does not fail — it returns a fluent English sentence that nobody
 * said, and that sentence then lands in the box where a prompt is typed. There is no
 * status code, no warning and nothing in the logs. A refusal is strictly better, and
 * the only way to know a refusal is still there is to ask for one.
 *
 * The mirror of it matters nearly as much and is easier to break by accident: English
 * must keep going to the free local model. Dictation on this box has been free since
 * it was built, and "add a hosted backend" is one careless line away from routing
 * every existing English recording through a metered third party, which nobody would
 * notice until a bill or a privacy conversation.
 *
 * There is now a third thing to keep true, and it is the reason the passes multiplied:
 * **the free backend has to be the one that answers.** Azure AI Speech hears Hebrew on
 * a tier that cannot bill, and OpenAI hears it for money, so an order that looks
 * arbitrary in the code is the difference between a feature that costs nothing and one
 * that costs per minute. It is asserted as "OpenAI was not called at all", because any
 * weaker assertion passes when both are called and only one is used.
 *
 * It runs in four passes, in four processes, because which backends exist is decided
 * when the module is imported and a key cannot be un-imported: a box with nothing on
 * it, a box with OpenAI, a box with both (this deployment), and a box with only the
 * free recognizer — which is the one that has to refuse a webm recording by talking
 * about the recording rather than about a key someone would have to buy. Each is
 * spawned from here with `fetch` replaced. No whisper is run, no network is touched,
 * and no audio is transcribed by anyone.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/transcribe-test.js
