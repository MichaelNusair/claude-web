/**
 * What is actually running on this box, and how to stop one of it.
 *
 * Every hard-won note in AGENTS.md was found the same way: an SSM shell, `ps`,
 * and `journalctl`. Ten never-spoken-to probe processes at ~205 MB each, 2.0 GB of
 * 7.8 GB. Three `claude` processes against one project, two devices telling
 * different stories. A tmux server in the wrong cgroup, discovered only when a
 * deploy killed the work it was supposed to protect. None of those were visible
 * from any of the app's own surfaces, and all of them are visible from `ps`.
 *
 * So this file is that shell, on a phone. It is read-only apart from three
 * explicit kills, and it deliberately does not become a monitoring system: no
 * history, no storage, no alerting. It answers "what is running right now" and
 * "why does this box feel wrong", which are the two questions that have actually
 * come up.
 *
 * THE BROKER GETS NO NEW OP, ON PURPOSE. Adding a list/kill op to
 * `claude-broker/broker.js` would be the obvious way to enumerate its sessions,
 * and it would be the wrong one: the conversations are children of that process,
 * so a change to it only takes effect at a restart, and a restart ends every live
 * conversation — the exact failure the broker exists to prevent. Its children are
 * ordinary processes owned by the same user as this service, so `ps` and `/proc`
 * answer most of this for free, and a SIGTERM to one of them is handled by the
 * broker's own exit handler, which tells the attached pages and unregisters the
 * session.
 *
 * What `ps` cannot answer is which conversation a process IS. Argv names one only
 * when the editor resumed it; a conversation started fresh is named by the CLI at
 * runtime, in an init event that only the broker sees — five of nine live
 * processes on the box, unnameable from outside. So the id comes from the READ-ONLY
 * `op: 'status'` the broker already answers, which is why this still needs no
 * change to `broker.js` and no restart: `chat-service/claude-status.js` has spoken
 * that op since it shipped. It is asked for a name, never for authority — every
 * stop still goes through a freshly-read process table and a parent we expected —
 * and an unanswered ask degrades to what argv says, never to a blank page.
 *
 * Security: this adds no authority. Every route in front of it sits behind the
 * same gate as `/ws`, which already hands the caller a shell with
 * `bypassPermissions`. What it must never do is turn a caller-supplied string
 * into a signal for an arbitrary process, so a pid is only ever signalled after
 * being found in a freshly-read process table under a parent we expected.
