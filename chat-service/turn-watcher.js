/**
 * Notice when a Claude session finishes a turn, and push it to the phone.
 *
 * Only sessions this app is *not* driving. A conversation held in the chat app
 * already announces itself on screen — the notification is for the ones the app
 * cannot see: the editor panel, and anything running under tmux. Those are the
 * sessions you start and then walk away from, which is the whole reason to want a
 * buzz in your pocket. The exclusion is by session id, taken from the manager's
 * own live list, so it stays right without either side knowing about the other.
 *
 * Why transcripts and not the broker. claude-broker owns the panel's process and
 * could in principle be asked to announce a turn ending, but it is a long-lived
 * process that predates this file and restarting it ends every live conversation
 * on the box. The transcripts are already the source of truth for
 * `/api/claude-status`, they are written by Claude Code itself for every surface
 * equally, and reading them needs nobody's cooperation. This costs one `stat` per
 * transcript every few seconds — 77 files here, about two milliseconds — and reads
 * only the ones that changed.
 *
 * What counts as "finished", and the two ways this could be annoying instead of
 * useful:
 *
 *   the transcript must be *left* idle — `stop_reason: end_turn`, not `tool_use` —
 *   and carry assistant text that is not the text already reported for that
 *   session. A turn that ends by running a tool is mid-thought, and the same text
 *   seen twice is a transcript being rewritten, not a new answer;
 *
 *   the message must be recent. A restored backup, a `git checkout` of a workspace,
 *   or anything else that touches many files at once must not fire a notification
 *   per conversation, so anything older than ten minutes is read for its state and
 *   never announced.
 *
 * And one thing that is announced without having finished at all: a turn that stopped
 * to ask you something. `state: 'question'` from claude-status.js — an `AskUserQuestion`
 * at the end of a transcript with no result under it. It fails both tests above, being
 * neither idle nor a new message, and it is the single most useful buzz this file can
 * send: nothing will happen in that conversation until a person goes and answers it.
 * On the transcripts here the median answer took three minutes and the slowest 5.9
 * hours, all of it reading as "Claude is working…" to anyone who looked.
 *
 * A turn that was *killed* is idle by both of those tests and is not finished, which
 * this used to announce as "Claude finished" over a body reading "No response
 * requested." — the harness artifact that stands where the answer would have been.
 * That is the one moment the person has to do something (come back and say
 * continue), described as the one moment they do not. So a cut-off turn is announced
 * in its own words; `cutOff` from claude-status.js is what tells them apart.
 *
 * And the first scan of a process announces nothing at all: a deploy restarts this
 * service, and a restart is not something Claude just said.

/**
 * Which project a transcript belongs to, and where it lives.

 * Transcript directories are named after the mangled cwd — every `/` and `.`
 * replaced by `-` — which cannot be turned back into a path, because the mangling

 * projects that exist and look the directory up. A conversation whose cwd is not a
 * project (someone's home directory, a checkout elsewhere) is absent from this map
 * and keeps the directory name, which is ugly but never wrong.
 *
 * The path is carried alongside the name because a notification now says where to go
 * when it is tapped, and the address of a project's window includes the folder for
 * code-server to open — `projectStartUrl` in manifest.js. This is the only side that
 * knows that path: the phone has the mangled directory name and nothing else.
 *
 * Only the top level of PROJECTS_ROOT, deliberately. A project is no longer the same
 * thing as a git repository — one can hold several — but a conversation's cwd is still
 * a project root, because that is what the chat app and the editor both open. If
 * something ever starts a conversation inside a sub-repository (`projects/foo/web`) it
 * will not be found here: that notification keeps the mangled directory name and
 * carries no URL, which is ugly and harmless rather than wrong. Walking deeper would
 * mean guessing which of several directories a person calls the project.
