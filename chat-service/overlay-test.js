/**
 * Boot the editor's mobile overlay in a real DOM and prove its escape hatch works.
 *
 * The overlay is injected raw into code-server by nginx, so nothing else ever
 * loads it: a runtime error at the top means the mic, the project switcher and
 * the layout rescue all silently vanish from the editor, and the only symptom is
 * buttons that aren't there. It has also mounted twice before, inside the Claude
 * panel's iframe, which is covered here too.
 *
 * The layout rescue gets the most attention because it is the part that cannot
 * report its own failure. It drives the mobile extension through a synthesised
 * keyboard chord, which is a contract between two files that share no code —
 * `pwa/mobile-overlay.js` decides which keys to send, `mobile-extension/
 * package.json` decides which keys mean something. If those drift apart, the
 * button stops working and nothing anywhere throws. So the chords are read out
 * of the extension's manifest and compared against what the buttons actually
 * dispatch.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/overlay-test.js

 *   the audio being played does not exist yet at that moment — so the element has
 *   to be unlocked *during* the tap and given its real source afterwards. Get this
 *   wrong and the feature works everywhere except the phone it was written for.
 *
 *   **The chain.** A message is several files. If the next one is not fetched
 *   while the current one plays there are gaps, and if `ended` does not chain, a
 *   phone says the first sentence of a summary and stops — which is worse than
 *   saying nothing, because you would believe it had finished.
 *
 *   **Stop.** Every fetch and every handler outlives the read that started it, so
 *   a piece arriving after Stop must not start playing.
 *
 *   **The fallback.** Every refusal — no budget left, no permission, no network —
 *   has to end with the message being read in the robotic voice rather than with
 *   silence, and the sheet has to say which voice it ended up using.

// ------------------------------------------ talking a message over out loud
/*
 * A spoken conversation about the message on the sheet — the editor's half of what
 * chat-service/talk-test.js checks in the chat app.
 *
 * Everything above is the overlay reading *to* you. This is the overlay letting you
 * answer back: a WebRTC session to OpenAI, opened with a credential this box mints and
 * spends nowhere near it, about one message and nothing else. Four things about it can
 * go wrong quietly, and they are what this section is for.
 *
 *   **It must not be able to reach Claude.** That is the promise the sheet makes in
 *   words, and on this surface the ways to break it are specific: this overlay drives
 *   the panel by dispatching keyboard chords and by writing to the clipboard. So a
 *   conversation is held open here while transcripts arrive, and the test asserts that
 *   not one chord is pressed, nothing is copied, and every request this page makes is
 *   one of the three read-only status routes it was already making.
 *
 *   **The microphone must not survive it.** Hang up, Close, a tap beside the sheet,
 *   another sheet drawn over it, a dropped line, the timer, every refusal, and the
 *   workbench reloading itself — eight ways out, and each one is checked for every
 *   track being stopped. A MediaStream that is merely dropped leaves the recording
 *   indicator lit and the phone listening.
 *
 *   **The gesture.** getUserMedia is refused on iOS outside a tap, and the microphone
 *   is asked for before the credential is minted — a session reserved against the day's
 *   count and then abandoned is one spent for nothing.
 *
 *   **The credential.** It is a bearer token for a metered third-party service. It may
 *   not be stored, printed, or put on the page.
