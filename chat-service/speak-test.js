/**
 * The voice that reads a message out loud, checked without spending anything.
 *
 * Two things here are worth more than the rest.
 *
 * **The segmenting.** It decides where the voice takes a breath and what gets
 * billed, and it is the one part of this that a listener can hear: a piece ending
 * mid-clause is audible as a stumble, and a first piece that grew past its limit is
 * heard as a long silence after the tap. So the checks are about the boundaries —
 * that the first piece is short, that the later ones are not, that no piece is
 * oversized, and that nothing said is lost or repeated between them.
 *
 * **The refusals.** Every one of them is a path a real phone reaches: a message
 * that aged out while the phone was in a pocket, a segment that does not exist, the
 * daily budget, a Polly call that fails. The overlay's answer to all of them is to
 * fall back to the browser's own voice, so a refusal that arrives as a hang, or as
 * a 500 with no sentence in it, is a read that goes quiet for no stated reason.
 *
 * **Which of the two voices reads it.** There are two synthesisers now, because
 * Polly cannot say a word of Hebrew — it skips the characters rather than reading
 * them badly, so a Hebrew message sent to the wrong one is read with holes in it and
 * nothing anywhere says so. The choice is therefore checked the way the refusals are:
 * the share that triggers it, the override, the 409 on a box with no key, and the
 * separate budget that keeps a third party's bill from being spent by a loop.
 *
 * `VoiceCache` takes its synthesiser as an argument for exactly this reason, and
 * `chooseVoice` and `speechStatus` take the voice list and the key as arguments too,
 * so everything below runs against fakes that count characters instead of Polly and
 * OpenAI, which charge for them: no credentials, no network, no bill. The two
 * synthesiser calls themselves are the part that cannot be checked here —
 * `/api/voice-status` is what reports whether they work on the box.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/speak-test.js
