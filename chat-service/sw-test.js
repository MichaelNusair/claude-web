/**
 * What tapping a notification does, which nothing else can check.
 *
 * pwa/sw.js runs in a service worker, and a service worker is the least observable
 * place this repository puts code: it has no DOM, no console anyone reads, and it is
 * woken by the operating system rather than by a page. A mistake in `notificationclick`
 * therefore has exactly one symptom — a notification that does nothing when tapped —
 * which is indistinguishable from the deliberate do-nothing this file's subject used to
 * be, and from a phone that simply delivered the tap somewhere else. That was the
 * reported bug, and it went unnoticed for as long as it did because no test loaded this
 * file at all.
 *
 * So the worker is loaded here with `self` stubbed — the only dependency it has — and
 * its two handlers are driven with the events a browser would hand them. What is
 * asserted is the part that cannot be seen from a phone: which window gets focused,
 * which URL gets opened when there is none, that the session id reaches the window
 * either way, and that a payload arriving from the network cannot send the tap to
 * another origin.
 *
 * Run: node chat-service/sw-test.js
