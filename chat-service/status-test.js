/**
 * What a device is told when it opens a conversation, and where each part came from.
 *
 * This exists because the two halves of the answer have different failure modes and
 * only one of them is trustworthy. "Is Claude working" is knowledge held by
 * claude-broker, which owns the process; the transcript can only show the state a
 * conversation was *left* in, which reads as "working" forever once a process dies
 * mid-turn. Conflating those would put "Claude is working…" over the editor of a
 * conversation that will never answer.
 *
 * The reading itself is the other half: it must find the newest message without
 * reading the transcript, because reading the transcript is precisely what the
 * panel already does and precisely why there is a wait to fix.
