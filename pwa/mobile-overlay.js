 * Mobile overlay for code-server: voice dictation + project switcher.

 * Design constraint learned the hard way: do not touch the workbench's DOM or
 * CSS. VS Code positions its parts with absolute inline styles computed in JS,
 * so hiding or resizing them via CSS desynchronises the layout and paints a
 * blank gray screen. Everything here lives in its own fixed-position container
 * appended to <body>, above the workbench, and never restyles it.
 *
 * The Claude Code panel is a webview iframe with its own document, so its input
 * cannot be written to directly. (Desktop VS Code serves webviews from
 * vscode-cdn.net; code-server serves them from this origin under
 * /stable-<commit>/static/. Either way they are a separate window.) Dictated
 * text is therefore delivered the two ways that work from outside a webview:
 *   1. clipboard — one tap to paste, works everywhere
 *   2. synthetic keystrokes into whatever has focus, for same-origin inputs
 * Both are offered; the UI is explicit about which it used.

  /*
   * Keep the server-side extension host alive when this page goes away, so a
   * refresh or a device switch doesn't kill the Claude turn in flight.
   *
   * VS Code Web already holds a disconnected extension host for
   * VSCODE_RECONNECTION_GRACE_TIME. What defeated it: on unload the client
   * sends a Disconnect control frame, which means "deliberate, dispose now" —
   * the server logs "The client has disconnected gracefully" and tears the host
   * down about two seconds later, mid-request.
   *
   * The earlier attempt at this rewrote workbench.js to skip that send. It
   * black-screened the editor on mobile, twice, and was reverted. This does the
   * same job from outside: drop the one frame on its way out of the socket, and
   * leave VS Code's own code untouched. If this script fails to load or throws,
   * the editor is exactly stock — the failure mode is "the old bug is back",
   * not "a broken bundle no browser can render".
   *
   * Wire format (out/vs/base/parts/ipc, confirmed against this build): a
   * 13-byte header — type u8, id u32be, ack u32be, dataLength u32be — followed
   * by dataLength bytes. Type 5 is Disconnect and carries no payload. The
   * writer can coalesce several frames into one send(), so walk the buffer and
   * strip only complete zero-length type-5 frames; anything that doesn't parse
   * as a clean frame sequence is passed through untouched rather than guessed
   * at. Dropping a byte of real protocol traffic would break the session far
   * worse than the bug being fixed.

   * an install depends on what is already on that home screen. Android matches an
   * installed web app to a page by *scope*, and the chat app's manifest used to claim
   * the whole origin — so with the chat icon installed, every project manifest served
   * from this origin looked to Chrome like that same app, whatever its `id` said. The
   * chat app has since been narrowed to /chat/, but a WebAPK installed before that
   * still holds the old scope until Chrome updates it, so this remains the way to
   * find out rather than assume:
   *
   *   - the build of this file, because a page open across a deploy is the other
   *     explanation for a feature that appears to be missing;
   *   - which manifest this page links, and what the server says is in it;
   *   - whether this is a browser tab at all — an install can only be offered from
   *     one, so doing this from inside an installed window explains the silence;
   *   - whether Chrome fired `beforeinstallprompt` for this page;
   *   - which installed app Chrome thinks belongs to this page, via
   *     getInstalledRelatedApps(). It only answers about apps the manifest declares
   *     as related, which is why manifest.js declares the chat app.

   *                          need. Here it is, in tens of milliseconds.

  /*
   * Say the last message out loud, when asked to.
   *
   * The other half of the mic. Dictation carries a phone-shaped question into
   * Claude; this carries the answer back out, for the times you are holding the
   * phone rather than reading it — walking, driving, or waiting on a turn that
   * has been running for an hour. The final message of a turn is the one worth
   * hearing: it is where the summary of everything that just happened is.
   *
   * It is a button, deliberately, and not something that fires whenever a turn
   * ends. A turn can finish while you are mid-sentence with someone, in another
   * app, or twenty minutes after you stopped waiting for it — and a phone that
   * starts talking by itself in any of those is worse than one that stays quiet.
   *
   * There is exactly one exception, and the point of it is that it cannot be any
   * of those cases: while the status sheet is open, a message arriving is read out
   * as it lands. That sheet is only open because it was tapped open, it is on
   * screen while it happens, and dismissing it ends it. See followStatusSheet —
   * everything here is still driven from a tap, one way or another.
   *
   * This cannot be done from the extension, and that is not a limitation of this
   * repo. The panel is a proprietary webview, and the extension host is a node
   * process with no audio device — nothing in either can make a sound. The
   * workbench page can, and it is also the one place that already has the text,
   * from /api/claude-status. So the overlay speaks, and the panel is untouched.
   *
   * There are two voices, and which one is used is a setting in this sheet.
   *
   *   The **server voice** is the default and the reason this feature is worth
   *   using: a neural voice synthesised by /api/speak and played here as ordinary
   *   audio, which sounds like a person reading rather than a satnav — see
   *   chat-service/speak.js. Which provider it comes from is that file's decision
   *   and not this one's: an Azure voice on the free tier where the box has the
   *   credentials, Polly's generative engine where it does not, and Polly at about
   *   seven cents a message for anyone who picks it in this sheet. Either way the
   *   first word takes about two seconds, which is why the server cuts a message
   *   into pieces and this plays them in a chain.
   *
   *   The **browser voice** is `speechSynthesis`, which was all of this feature
   *   until now. It is instant and free and it sounds like a satnav from 2009. It
   *   stays for three reasons that are all real: it works with no AWS permission
   *   at all, it is what answers when the server refuses or the network is gone,
   *   and it is the only one that starts the very instant a thumb comes off the
   *   button. Anyone who prefers it can pick it.
   *
   * Two constraints shape the rest, and both are ones the dictation sheet already
   * lives with:
   *
   *   iOS refuses speech that did not start inside a tap. So the first utterance
   *   is queued synchronously from the click handler, never after an `await` —
   *   exactly the rule the clipboard write follows. `openStatus` has already
   *   refreshed the status, so the text is in hand and nothing is fetched here.
   *
   *   Speaking while the recognizer is listening dictates Claude's own words back
   *   into the composer. So opening the dictation sheet stops the speech, and
   *   this never starts while dictation is running.
   */

   * So the silence comes from `/api/speak/silence` and the segments are played
   * straight from `/api/speak`. The policy belongs to code-server, ships in its
   * server bundle with per-build nonces, and would be undone by the next upgrade if
