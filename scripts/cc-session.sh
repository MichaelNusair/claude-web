#
# cc — open, or rejoin, a permanent Claude Code session for a project.
#
# Why this exists: the VS Code extension's Claude process is a child of the
# extension host, and code-server tears that down within seconds of the last
# browser WebSocket closing. Measured on this box: extension host and `claude`
# both dead 5 seconds after the tab closed, mid-turn, with the work lost.
#
# tmux moves the process into a server that is detached from every terminal, so:
#   * closing the editor, the browser, or the laptop lid changes nothing
#   * attaching from a second device joins the SAME live session — same screen,
#     same scrollback, both cursors — rather than starting a second Claude
#   * the session outlives code-server restarts and redeploys
#
# It runs the real CLI, so model switching (/model), permission modes, @file
# references, thinking and tool output are all the genuine Claude Code UX rather
# than a reimplementation of it.
#
# This is no longer only a power-user command: the editor surface opens Claude
# through it (see mobile-extension/extension.js), because the extension's own
# webview cannot survive a page reload — a reload builds a new extension host,
# and the panel's `claude` is a child of the old one. So the options set below
# are tuned for a phone attached to a long-lived session, not just for an ssm
# shell.

# Being detached from the terminal is not by itself enough to survive a deploy.
# tmux sessions are forked by the tmux server, so they inherit its cgroup, and a
# server first started from an editor terminal sits inside code-server.service —
# which is KillMode=control-group, so `systemctl restart code-server` takes the
# sessions with it. Observed 2026-09-17, mid-deploy, on a running task. The fix is
# claude-tmux.service owning the server (see infra/userdata/bootstrap.sh); all
# this can do is say so, because an unprivileged `cc` cannot move a process
# between cgroups. A warning rather than a refusal: the session works, it is only
# fragile, and refusing to open Claude would be the worse outcome.
