// One `claude` process per conversation, shared by every browser page.
//
// The problem it solves: code-server creates one extension host per browser
// page, and the Claude Code panel's `claude` is a child of that host. Open the
// same project on a phone and a laptop and you get two processes resuming one
// session id, both appending to one transcript, telling two different stories.
// Observed on this box: two extension hosts, three `claude` processes, one
// project. The panel cannot fix this itself — nothing shares an extension host
// between two page loads.
//
// So the panel's stdio is routed here through claude-broker/wrapper, and this
// keeps the process. Both pages then drive the same conversation.
//
// It is deliberately BYTE-TRANSPARENT. It does not translate the stream-json
// vocabulary the way chat-service/session-manager.js does, because it is not
// building a UI — it is standing in for a pipe. Whatever the CLI writes, each
// attached page receives verbatim, which is what lets the extension's own UI
// keep working without knowing any of this is happening.
//
// Security: the control channel is a unix socket inside a 0700 directory owned by
// the service user, never a TCP port. Anything that can write to it can run
// `claude` as that user — but anything that can write to it already has that
// user's shell, so this adds no reachable surface. Do not move it to a port.

 * every transcript on the box, against 5606 `assistant` entries. So "is Claude
 * working right now, or is it my turn" exists in this process and nowhere else,
 * which is what `op: 'status'` is for.
 *
 * Matched as a substring rather than by parsing each line. This runs on every
 * chunk of every conversation, and one bit does not justify JSON.parse over a
 * stream that can reach MAX_LOG_BYTES. The failure mode is also the harmless
 * one: a missed `result` leaves the answer at "working" until the next turn
 * ends, which is a stale badge, not a broken conversation.

 * `--setting-sources`, and every permission decision, mode change and auth probe
 * comes back down this same pipe as a `control_request`/`control_response` frame.
 *
 * Treating any write as the beginning of a turn therefore latched `turnInFlight`
 * on permanently, because a control frame draws no `result` to clear it. Measured
 * on the box before this fix: 11 of 13 live sessions reported "working", nine of
 * them processes that had never run a single turn. A badge that says "working"
 * about everything answers nothing.

 * Claude session sends this one a message, when a queued message is flushed, when
 * a /loop wakeup or a cron fires, or when a hook injects one. All of those reach
 * the CLI by its own socket, not down the stdin this daemon holds, so
 * `#noteTurnStart` never sees them and `turnInFlight` stayed false for the whole
 * turn. Measured on the box before this fix: koinespace session 44e6ff2e took a
 * cross-session message at 02:48:02, was running a tool five minutes later, and
 * `op: 'status'` called it idle throughout — three polls in a row — while the
 * transcript plainly read `working`. A badge that says "your turn" while Claude is
 * mid-tool is the direction that makes you type over live work, which is the one
 * thing this flag exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the *output* side decides a turn has begun: an assistant event means the
 * model is producing, whoever asked. That cannot latch on the way counting any
 * stdin write did, for two reasons — a `result` always follows an assistant event
 * in the same turn and clears it, and a resumed conversation replays nothing.

 * `AskUserQuestion` are both a `control_request` written to stdout, after which the
 * CLI blocks until a `control_response` comes back up stdin. No `result` is written
 * in the meantime, so the turn is legitimately in flight — and nothing will move

/**
 * Answer "what is running, and is it working" for every live conversation.
 *
 * Why this is here and not read off the disk: opening a conversation on a second
 * device makes the panel re-read and re-render the whole transcript, which is
 * seconds of waiting on a large one — and the thing you actually want to know
 * first is whether to wait at all. If a turn is in flight the answer is coming and
 * the history is worth waiting for; if it is not, the last message is the only
 * thing you need before replying. Nothing on disk distinguishes those two states
 * (see RESULT_EVENT), and this process is the only one that sees the stream.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. `env` and `args` are not reported: the env is the editor's
 * whole environment, it reaches this daemon only because the wrapper has to pass
 * it through, and a status reader has no use for it. What is here is what a device
 * needs to decide whether to wait, plus the pid, because the thing most likely to
 * be debugged over this socket is which process a conversation is actually in.
