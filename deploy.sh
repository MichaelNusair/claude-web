# --app-only ships the payload to the instance that is already running and skips
# `cdk deploy` entirely. It exists because a full deploy driven from the box
# itself cannot finish: CloudFormation applies a UserData change by *stopping*
# this instance, rewriting the attribute and starting it again, and every stage
# after `cdk deploy` — the SSM waits, the payload push, the verification — dies
# with the box. Measured on 2026-09-18: change set executed 09:47:17, instance
# stopped 09:47:24, started 09:47:48, stack green at 09:48:02 with no payload
# ever pushed.
#
# It applies everything in the payload — chat service, both extensions, the
# overlay, `cc` — *and* the provisioning script itself: infra/userdata/bootstrap.sh
# now ships in the payload and is installed the way a boot installs it, then run.
# That is deliberate, and it is the fix for the second half of the trap above: the
# stop/start means cloud-init never re-runs (its scripts-user stage is once per
# instance, not per boot), so nothing else on the box ever refreshes
# /opt/bootstrap.sh. The stack would go green carrying a new script that the
# running instance had never executed — which is how a /p/ route sat in the
# template for fifteen minutes without existing in nginx.
#
# So: --app-only from the box ships app *and* provisioning changes. A full deploy
# from a machine that is not the box is still what updates the stack, so that a
# replacement boots the same script this installs, and it is the only thing that
# can change AWS resources. That is no longer advice: a full deploy started on the
# stack's own instance is refused a few dozen lines below, before anything is built
# and before any AWS write.

Refusing a full deploy: this is the instance the stack manages ($SELF_ID).

CloudFormation applies a UserData change by stopping this instance and starting
it again. Everything this script does after 'cdk deploy' — waiting for SSM,
pushing the payload, checking that the app still requires a login — would die
with the box, leaving the stack green and the running app never updated.

Two ways forward:

  ./deploy.sh --app-only      Ships the app and infra/userdata/bootstrap.sh to
                              the running instance. No AWS resource changes.

  From any other machine:     git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main
                              ./deploy.sh
                              This is the only thing that can change the stack.

Push your work first either way: this script ships the working tree it is run
from, so a deploy box with a stale clone will quietly ship stale code.

# This one mints a credential for a browser to talk to OpenAI directly, and the
# conversation it opens deliberately cannot reach Claude — no tools, no import that
# could. Most of what this checks is that boundary, because the failure it prevents
# is a voice with no transcript saying "done, I pushed it" when nothing was pushed.
# The rest is the money: the daily count is spent before the call and handed back if

# thing that fails without failing: the model installed on this box is
# `ggml-base.en.bin`, and handed Hebrew it returns a fluent English sentence
# nobody said, straight into the box where a prompt is typed. So this checks that
# a non-English request never reaches it — and, in a second pass with a fake key,
# that English still goes to the free local model rather than quietly starting to

# /chat/admin can signal processes, so what it *refuses* is the code under test:
# nothing stopped mid-turn without an answered question, no pid signalled that has
# not just been re-found under the broker, and no session name handed to tmux
# unvalidated. Runs the page in a DOM too, since this is the surface you would be

# This header earns its place by being the answer to "why does the deploy always

#
# Three things made a stall here silent and unbounded, and all three are fixed
# below. `2>/dev/null` threw away the reason. The AWS CLI's default timeouts are
# 60s per attempt with retries on top. And stdin was still the terminal, so a
# profile whose credentials come from something interactive — an SSO device code,
